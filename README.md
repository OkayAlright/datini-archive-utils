# Contribution Guide:
For any feature or fix, please open a ticket in the issue tracker in this format:

     <type-of-issue>/<short-description>
     
The type-of-issue might be "regression", "improvement", or "possible-project". 
Other types might be added later.

An example of the description might be "sum-letters-per-month" for a function that 
sums the letter sent by a single actor per month in a given csv.

All developement on a ticket issue should be done on a new branch by 
THE SAME NAME AS THE TICKET IT IS CONNECTED TO. That will help keep us sane.
Once you have tested your additon/fix, open a pull request. Once there is at
least one review approving a merge, feel free to merge with master.

At this point, some major functionality might change, so brace for that.
